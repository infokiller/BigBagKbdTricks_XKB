DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks
====================================

### For Linux (updated to XKB-data v2.23.1-1ubuntu1, 2018-08)

* New "Colemak[eD]" AltGr mappings (lv3-4) putting dead keys on AltGr+symbol keys and reworking most other mappings
* Angle/Wide ergo modifications to improve wrist angles, hand spacing and right pinky stretch/load effort
* Curl(DH) ergo modifications to encourage natural finger curvature
* An "Extend" layer using Caps Lock as a modifier (lv5-8) for navigation/editing from the home position and more
* For several locales, a 'Unified Symbols' layout with only a few necessary changes from the standard Colemak[eD];
  Also, a layout to 'Keep Local Symbols' like their default (QWERTY-type) counterparts for that locale
* Intuitive phonetic layouts for Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew scripts
* Mirrored Colemak that allows one-handed typing (if I ever break an arm...)
* The 4 Tarmak transitional Colemak layouts for learning Colemak (or Colemak-Curl) in smaller steps if desired

Run the install and setxkb scripts with -h (or look inside them) for more help and info about their workings!

There are plenty of explanations and further links in there, as well as links to files.

Happy XKB hacking!
