DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks
====================================

For Linux (updated to XKB-data v2.12.1)

* New "Colemak[eD]" AltGr mappings (lv 3-4) putting dead keys on AltGr+symbol keys and reworking most other mappings
* An Extend layer using Caps Lock for its modifier (lv 5-8; "Extend") for navigation from the home position and more
* Angle/Wide modifications to improve wrist angles, hand spacing and right pinky stretch/load effort
* Curl modifications to improve hand curvature
* For several locales, a 'Unified Symbols' layout with only a few necessary locale changes from the standard Colemak[eD];
* Also, a layout to 'Keep Local Symbols' like their default (QWERTY-type) counterparts and key cap markings for that locale
* Access to Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew letters using layout toggling to intuitive phonetic Colemak layouts
* Access to a mirrored Colemak that allows one-handed typing (I haven't used it much - but if I ever break an arm...!)
* The 4 Tarmak transitional Colemak layouts for learning Colemak in smaller steps if so desired
